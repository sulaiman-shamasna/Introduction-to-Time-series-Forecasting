    "In this notebook, we will learn how to work with and predict time series. Time series are a collection of time-dependent data points. That means that each data point is assigned to a specific timestamp. Ideally, these data points are in chronological order and in contant time intervals (e.g. every minute or everyday). The time series forecasting problem analyzes patterns in the past data to make predictions about the future. The most popular example is probably stock price prediction. Other examples are sales of seasonal clothing or weather forecasts. In contrast to regression problems, time series are time-dependent and show specific characteristics, such as trend and seasonality."
